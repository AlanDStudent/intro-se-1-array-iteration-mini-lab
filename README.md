# Iteration

### Introduction

Iterate literally means 'to perform repeatedly'. While human beings get bored of doing something repeatedly, machines excel at it.

To "iterate over an array" means to perform the same task over and over again, once for each item in the array.

There are several ways to iterate over an array, but here's a list of some of the most useful methods you may consider looking up:
* `.each` iteration
* `.each_with_index` iteration
* `for ___ in ____` iteration
* `.times do` iteration

### Try it out

The challenges and the datasets are all in a file called `iterate.rb`, and you'll be writing your own puts or print statements.

To test your code, type `ruby iterate.rb` in the console.
